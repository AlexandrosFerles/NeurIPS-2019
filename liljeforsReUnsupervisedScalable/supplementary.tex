\title{\textit{Supplementary material for} [Re] Unsupervised Representation Learning for Multivariate Timeseries}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

In this section, we present the full results of our experiments on the UCR and UEA Archives.

\section{UEA Archive Results}
The following is our full results on the 30 UEA datasets. Note that we were not able to reproduce the SVM results for the InsectWingbeat dataset since it has a very large number of samples (30,000 training and 20,000 test samples), and we could not manage to train the SVM on it in a timely manner (training the SVM was taking more than a day using the scikit-learn library.)
